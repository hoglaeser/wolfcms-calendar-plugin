<h1>WolfCMS Calendar Plugin</h1>
<p>The plugins lets to maintain <b>a simple events list</b> and to show the event(s) in the frontend. Each event has its:<br>
<ol>
<li>Title,</li>
<li>Date,</li>
<li>Date of end (optional),</li>
<li>Description (optional).</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>The plugin also, or maybe first of all, <b>adds a <i>calendar</i> behaviour</b>.</p>

<p><i>Calendar</i> behaviour lets to show events in the particular day (similar to the <i>Archive</i> behaviour).</p>

<p>With the calendar plugin one can show a clickable calendar view <sup>(1)</sup>. Events are presented on the view with boxes in appropriate days. The <i>calendar</i> behaviour lets to "travel" in the past and in the future.</p>

<p>Clicking on a day with an event redirects to a "the day" page, which lists all events (title, dates, description) from that day. "The day" page can be easy customized with the standard WolfCMS subpage system.</p>

<p>The plugin comes with a default cascade style sheet file, designed and tested on the default WolfCMS theme. However, I believe, it will work with other themes as well; maybe even without any modifications. If mods are needed, the CSS is simple and easy to change.</p>

<p>Before the publication, the plugin had been being used on a real, living page. And worked very well with Wolf CMS 0.7.8.</p>

<p>All views are translatable. There are three translations included: Polish, English and Dutch. The names of days of the week and of months are based on a current system locale.</p>

<p><sup>(1) the calendar view should be used on the top _calendar_ behaviour page; but it's not a requirement</sup></p>
